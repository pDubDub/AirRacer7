• change scores.txt to save/load an array/dictionary of pylon:time pairs

* might try angling headings of turning plane sprites?



might reduce x/y movement rates



• might make the finish line an extra pylon in the form of a gate?

• at last pylon. drop plane speed to zero

• altitude
	• throttle greater than altitude should climb, and vice versa

* polish dx
	• make ramp up, so plane has inertia in corners
	• make dx a little dependent on speed
		(but probably less dx at speed?)

* add trees
	• maybe farmhouses?

• might use Opp class for opponent (obstacle) planes
