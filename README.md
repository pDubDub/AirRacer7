# AirRacer7
A 2D arcade racer game writen in Python for my CIS151 course at MCC, Fall 2019.

Based on an unfinished 2D arcade shooter game using pygame written in PyCharm with a paper airplane that moved about the screen based on mouse movement, we were tasked with making numerous fixes and updates to the shooter game.

I proposed instead to turn it into an airplane racer game, somewhat inspired by a favorite Atari 2600 game, "Sky Jinks" from 1982, originally by Bob Whitehead.

Version 7 after I added sound effects for the airplane was the state when I turned it in.
I completed version 8 the following week, adding a scores.txt file so that the game could recall the best time every time the game was run.
